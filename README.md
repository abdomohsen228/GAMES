# C++ Console Game App

This is a console-based C++ application featuring three games: **Connect 4**, **Tic-Tac-Toe**, and an unbeatable **AI player** that always wins or ties. The app is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with clean code architecture and modularity to ensure smooth and efficient gameplay.

## Features
